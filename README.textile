h1. HBase Adapter

Wrapping up all of that HBase Thrift stuff so you can use it.

h2. Dependencies

Install HBase and Thrift normally (for some definition of "normally" for your platform).  This code was developed against HBase 0.20.5

gem install hbase-thrift

h2. Alpha

This is very alpha and may not be production ready.  Contributions are welcome though.

h2. TODO

h3. Thrift

All Thrift structures and services (even redundant ones) are represented as more idiomatic Ruby classes and methods except the following:

Thrift data structures:

* Some of the attributes on ColumnDescriptor
* TRegionInfo: probably just going to wrap in something with Ruby style attribute names.

Thrift service methods:

* atomicIncrement (spec'd & implemented, but there's a Java error)
* scannerOpen
* scannerOpenWithStop 
* scannerOpenWithPrefix
* scannerOpenTs 
* scannerOpenWithStopTs
* scannerGet
* scannerGetList
* scannerClose

h3. Documentation

Some documentation would be good...

h3. Other

A lot of the code could be DRYer.  Also, I'd like to make it so we don't have to keep dropping and creating tables in tests.

h2. Contributing

Fork the repository at http://github.com/AndrewO/hbase-adapter and send me a pull request.

Happy hacking.
